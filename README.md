# Predicting NBA win probability using machine learning methods

## Summary

The aim of this project is to harness historical NBA data in order to gain insights into what statistical factors make a team successful in a given season. The team of focus for this project is the Golden State Warriors, and the box score data for each game within the span of the most recent NBA season is accessed via the Sports Reference API. The concepts and algorithms used range from Bayesian probability to more advanced ML models such as logistic regression and decision trees. With sports fanatics, NBA analysts, and players / coaches in mind, the final deliverable will be a data-driven report with an emphasis on strategic actionability. That is, the results of the model should ideally shed light on how to maximize wins for the GSW in the future.

## Introduction 

I am interested in this domain because I am an NBA fan (specifically, a Warriors fan) and I wanted to have a better insight into what factors would make it more likely for the Warriors to win a given game.  I figured the best way to do this would be through a Machine Learning model, because it would be able to identify patterns or correlations within the data and make informed predictions. This data could be utilized by sports analysts, coaches, players, etc. who want a better understanding of what statistical elements of a game are impactful, and to what extent, as well as what combinations of stats within a game would give a team the best chance of winning.
